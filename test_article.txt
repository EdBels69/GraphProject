Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.
The protein p53 has recently been shown to regulate glucose metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of Metformin on p53 expression in liver cells.
We found that Metformin activates AMPK, which in turn phosphorylates p53, leading to cell cycle arrest.
Interestingly, patients with T2DM showed reduced levels of p53 compared to healthy controls.
This suggests a novel link between the tumor suppressor p53 and metabolic regulation in diabetes.
Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of mTOR pathway reversed the effects of Metformin.
These findings highlight the complex interplay between metabolic pathways and cell cycle regulators.
